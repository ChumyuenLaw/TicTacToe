# TicTacToe - EE5415 Individual Project

## Completed
1. the basic functions of the Tic Tac Toe game
2. Making the app support multiple language with use of the strings.xml
3. Improve the game to support both portrait and landscape display mode. It is required to make the app’s data persist when the orientation is changed.
4. In the basic game implementation, the human always goes first. Make the game fairer by alternating who gets to go first. Also keep track of how many games the user has won, the
computer has won, and ties. You should display this information using TextView controls under the game status TextView.

- Difficulty – to set the AI difficulty level to Easy (Level 1), Harder (Level 2), or Expert (Level 3)
- Quit – to quit the app
- Clear cache - to clear the game statistics
